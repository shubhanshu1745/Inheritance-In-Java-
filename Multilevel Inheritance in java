//Defination of Multilevel Inheritance 
/*
Multilevel inheritance is a concept in Java where a derived class extends another derived class. This creates a hierarchy of inheritance with a parent class and multiple levels of subclasses.
*/

/*
Syntax :

class A {} // Parent class or Level 1

class B extends A {} // Level 2 subclass extending Level 1

class C extends B {} // Level 3 subclass extending Level 2
